Corporate Web
=============

This application has been created for the 2014 Spring ISU Cyber Defense Competition. It has been built (intentionally) poorly; Following bad coding practices, terrible commit messages and comments, terrible documentation etc. 

This is definitely not my best work.

This should never be used in a production environment. 

To run this server, use the command:
'$python3 manage.py runserver 8080'
